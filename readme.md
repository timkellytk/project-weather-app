# JavaScript Weather App

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)

The weather app lets you search up any location in the world and get real-time weather data using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/). The app auto-fills the locations using the [Algolia Places API](https://community.algolia.com/places/) and gets a photo of the location using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
